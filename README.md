## Kera Ganatantra

This project is an open-source protest against the corruption and the joke that has been made of our democracy in Nepal.

We invite everyone to contribute, collaborate, and raise awareness. Together, we stand against injustice and demand accountability.

No individual names are credited; this is a collective effort for change.

## How It Works

Kera Ganatantra visualizes data about corruption scandals and misuse of public funds in Nepal. The project uses interactive charts and components to highlight the impact and scale of these issues.

All data is sourced from public records, news articles, and verified reports. The main data files are:

- `src/components/scandal/data/budget.ts`: Contains budget and financial data related to scandals.
- `src/components/scandal/data/scandal.ts`: Contains details of individual corruption scandals.

The frontend is built with React and Vite for fast, modern web development.
